You start with a 'failed' ritual and dead bodies.
You have 10 clues out in the area.
5 are about the creature type.
5 are about its location
With 5 creatures you get 25 type clues. (But modt are duplicates between creatures, for example both cats and dogs have fur)
Each type relates differently to the clues, but there are at most 10 written clues (25 events, but duplicated in the same way)
That makes


-----nope, tooo much noope----
Up to 10 tracks of 5 different types. (Slime, blood, animal tracks, chill and miasma) 

When tracking. Click the clue icon and actively track (action icon) 

The event checks if each track is far enugh to be in that position.
(Numbers are hardcoded into the tokens and the A,B,C and so on are set to the hard numbers.) (The As could be numbers 100-199, Bs 200-299 a.s.o.)
(In the beginning certain tracks get a Amax and Amin to compare with. Also an Atype for the type of track. Which is determined by what the monster is.)
The variable settings in the beginning give wheight to certain monsters and runs them though their tracks a certain amount, harder is shorter tracks and/or more tracks. Some monsters are cats. Who are false leads.
(As time passes the Amin and Amax increase by 1. If they ever reach their end and monster isn't caught. The game fails.)
As in 1 chance new path. 1 for shortened path(min3), 1 for 1 step further along (max15)
